# ChatPlays
A Twitch or whatever service you want plays bot written in C++
Will be compatible with emulator IPC Protocols such as PINE.

The bot currently features support for the PINE protocol in PCSX2 and soon to be RPCS3 that allows for live on the fly edits of game memory allowing for tailored custom commands for each and every game experience developed for chat with it. More information can be found at: https://code.govanify.com/govanify/pine
The bot features ViGEm, https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmClient for setup and installation before attempted use of the bot in windows. Which is used to generate a virtual xbox controller intended for general chat input in Windows. Though can be used for TAS like input handling with PINE when nessacary for custom commands.

Linux support with an evdev based controller is currently in WIP.
